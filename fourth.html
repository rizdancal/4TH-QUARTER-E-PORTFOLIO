        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p align="left"> I would like to thank first of all our Almighty Jesus for helping me throughout this school year. To my family, friends, teachers, classmates, everyone who supported me, to my seniors from Grade 12, 11, Commitment to Imaginative, to my supportive juniors, online or long-distance friends, and of course to the girl who helped me through my ups and downs, Apple, this A.Y. '24 - '25. Truly, this year is full of blessings and learning experiences.<br><br>I will always remember the kulitans, asarans, and sermons in our ICT class. The lessons I didn't get, the hands-ons that I always failed, but still, I learned a lot not just in the subject itself but also the application of it in real life. <br><br> I have nothing to say anymore, my smile and jokes every discussion show how much I am grateful to have Miss Uminga as our ICT teacher. God bless you po Miss, see you po when I see you :)). </p>
